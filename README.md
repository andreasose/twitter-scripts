Set of different scripts for downloading and manipulating Twitter data

In this repository I'm aiming to collect and write down a couple of useful scripts for handling and analyzing twitter data AS EASILY AS POSSIBLE for non-programmers. Some familiarity with R will be assumed, but the aim is to keep things as simple as possible so that more people can benefit.

There will be one script for downloading all tweets from a list of usernames, as well as some different scripts showing how to pull out and analyse the most relevant metadata.
